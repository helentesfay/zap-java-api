# ZAP Java API

This project aims to Mavenize the [ZAP Java API](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/ApiJava) from [OWASP ZAP](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) so it can be deployed to the [Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/) and easily used by everyone.

All the classes related to the API are simply copied from ZAP's project and no modifications are made.
